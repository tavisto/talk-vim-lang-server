It's just this thing you know?

# So how do you set these up with Vim?

## [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

> It's a completion framework and language server client which supports extension features of VSCode.

## Wait, VSCode? I thought you were a terminal only type of operator!?

- VSCode Is one of the few editors that have come out I have considered switching to.
